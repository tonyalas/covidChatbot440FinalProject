# covidChatbot440FinalProject
A final project for COMP-4400 Principles of Programming Languages that consists of an interactive Covid-19 Chatbot written in Prolog that will ask a series of questions to determine if you should contact a medical professional or not. 
Every user response should be formatted like so:
procName(userResponse).      (where the period is necessary)
An example of this would be if the bot asks for your name and the user can respond with:
name(tony).
For some responses, the user will need to enter a '.' (period) in order to proceed to the next question.
This program was written with SWI-Prolog in mind, so it works best if you have the SWI-Prolog application (either on Windows or MAC) and consult the file from within the program. OR the user can run from the terminal application of their choice.
